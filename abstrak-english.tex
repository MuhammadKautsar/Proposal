\textit{In Banda Aceh City, the understanding of the hydroponic system in this city is still relatively new. The business process carried out by Banda Aceh hydroponic farmers to sell their crops is still using social media such as Instagram and WhatsApp. By using the social media Instagram or WhatsApp, the revenue or sales they get are mostly only from the communities they follow. From the results of interviews with several hydroponic farmers in Banda Aceh City, it is known that they need a solution to sell and expand the marketing of their hydroponic plants. This research will design and build a marketplace application using the Scrum method. The purpose of compiling this research is to produce a web-based marketplace application for hydroponic farmers in Banda Aceh City. Applications that have been built can be a medium or intermediary for business processes between sellers and hydroponic farmers.}
